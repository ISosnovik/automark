# Example
As an example we create a server application with 2 assignments. We assume that there are 5 test users in our classroom. The first assignment is to implement simple *matrix-by-matrix multiplication*. And the second assignment is to implement the *sigmoid function*.

Run 
```bash
bash prepare_test_env.sh
```
The script creates the appropriate folder structure for the server application, creates test users and generates the assignments.



Run `python ../automark_server/main.py` to launch the server application.

You can open `student_notebook.ipynb` to check the client-side experience.
